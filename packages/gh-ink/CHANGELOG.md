# @kud/gh-ink

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 04ffe69: Add the inbox shell — the browse screen, action menu, layout, navigation and `App` extracted from ambre's cockpit, so a second surface can have the same interface with different queries.

  Host-supplied where the shell used to assume its first host: `detailFor` (the drill-in view, on the same seam as `extensions`), `title` (the header brand, loading line and empty message), and `isWorkRepo` / `initialIncludeWork` (the work ⇄ home split). The duplicated `Health` union and its display tables are gone in favour of `@kud/gh` and this package's own `health-display`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- f476456: `HealthPanel` only spaces a summary row from the list above it when that list has entries. On a PR with no checks and no reviewers, Checks / Reviews / Merge previously rendered with a blank line between each, spacing rows apart from nothing.

  `CommentsPanel` gains `showConversationHeading` (default `true`). Hosts that already name the section — cockpit puts the payload behind a "Conversation" tab — can turn off the panel's own heading instead of stacking the same word twice. The "Review threads" heading is unaffected, since it separates two genuinely different lists.

  The empty state no longer says "on this PR": the panel now also renders issue conversations, which have no review threads.
