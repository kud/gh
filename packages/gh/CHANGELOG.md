## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 1bdf706: Add `buildInboxQuery` — the account-wide "what's on my plate" query in one
  GraphQL round-trip: my PRs, review requests, reviews given, assigned work,
  issues and PRs on my repos, and recently closed.

  Extracted from ambre's cockpit, where it was the last piece of shared GitHub
  logic still living in a consumer. Query only — assembling the result into
  sections stays with the surface, since a terminal inbox and a web dashboard
  group the same rows differently.

  Two changes on the way across: `repo` and the done-window are now named options
  (`buildInboxQuery({ repo, doneWithinDays })`), and the window date is computed
  per call rather than at module load — a long-running server would otherwise
  freeze "recently done" to the day it booted.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- f476456: `fetchPrComments` now returns the PR description as the conversation's first entry, the way GitHub's own Conversation tab treats it. A PR whose body carries its whole argument previously rendered as having nothing said on it, which reads as empty rather than unanswered.

  Conversation comments also carry `createdAt`, and a null body (what GitHub returns for a description-less PR) no longer throws.
